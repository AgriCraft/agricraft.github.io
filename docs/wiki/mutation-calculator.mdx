## How cross-breeding (and mutations) works
A cross-breeding is generated when a random tick happen on an empty cross cropstick.
When this happens, valid neighbours are determined. A valid neighbour is a plant mature and fertile.
These candidates are filtered by their fertility (if the fertility of the plant is less than a random number between min-fertility and max-fertility, the plant is removed from the candidates)
If only one plant is remaining, a clone of this plant is produced. (see later for more explanation).
If more are remaining, a cross-breeding is produced.

### Clone

A random number is generated, if it is less than the spread chance of the plant, a clone is really produced.
When the clone is produced, there is a chance the genes are mutated (see later for more explanation).

### Cross-breeding

The detected plants are sorted by their fertility (high fertility is first), and the two first plants are chosen.
A new plant is produced with a random allele (dominant or recessive) from each parent. A mutation may happen on each genes.

### Mutation

A random mutation happen after generating a random number (between min-mutativity and max-mutativity).
If it is less than the mutativity stat of the gene, the mutation happen.
A mutation is either good (+1 is stat) or bad (-1 in stat). It is determined by another random number.
If `random(min-mutativity, max-mutativity) < (max-mutativity + gene-mutativity)/2` then the mutation is good, else the mutation is bad.
Mutativity stat of 1 results in 25/50/25 probability of positive/no/negative mutation.
Mutativity stat of 10 results in 100/0/0 probability of positive/no/negative mutation.
