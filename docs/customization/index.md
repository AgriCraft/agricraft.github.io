# AgriCraft Customization

This guide will help you customize AgriCraft 4.0 using a datapack and a resourcepack.  It is assumed you have experience creating datapacks and resourcepacks for Minecraft.

To add additional content, refer to one of the five sections, each corresponding to a specific datapack registry exposed by AgriCraft
- [Add a new plant](./plant.mdx)
- [Add a new plant mutation](./mutation.md)
- [Add a new soil](./soil.md)
- [Add a new fertilizer](./fertilizer.md)
- [Add a new weed](./weed.md)

Additionally, you can learn how to [remove default plants, mutations and more](./removing-data.md).

## Migrating from AgriCraft 3.1.0 to 4.0

The tool to migrate your AgriCraft data to 4.0's datapack and resourcepack system can be found [here](https://github.com/PiotrO15/AgriCraft-Data-Converter).
