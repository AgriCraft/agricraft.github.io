# AgriCraft Customization

This documentation will guide you on how to customize AgriCraft 3.2.0 with a datapack and a resourcepack.  
It is assumed you know how to create datapacks and resourcepacks for Minecraft.

This guide is split on 5 parts, one for each datapack registry AgriCraft exposes:
- [Add a new plant](./plant.mdx)
- [Add a new plant mutation](./mutation.md)
- [Add a new soil](./soil.md)
- [Add a new fertilizer](./fertilizer.md)
- [Add a new weed](./weed.md)

## Migrating from AgriCraft 3.1.0 to 4.0

A tool will be provided to easily migrate your custom config.
This will be updated when the tool is available.
